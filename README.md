# Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree

All of the projects were submitted for Udacity's [Data Engineering Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027) course.

### Course objectives
Learn to design data models, build data warehouses and data lakes, automate data pipelines, and work with
massive datasets.

Educational Objectives:
- Create user-friendly relational and NoSQL data models
- Create scalable and efficient data warehouses
- Work efficiently with massive datasets
- Build and interact with a cloud-based data lake
- Automate and monitor data pipelines
- Develop proficiency in Spark, Airflow, and AWS tools

### Project 1:  Data Modeling with Postgres
This project is to learn building an ETL-pipeline to create tables, and load the data of JSON files into the database in PostgreSQL.

### Project 2: Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra
This project is to learn building an ETL-pipeline to create tables, and load the data of JSON files into the database in NoSQL database, Apache Cassandra.

### Project 3: Build a Cloud Data Warehouse
This project is to learn building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables.

### Project 4: Build a Data Lake
This project is to learn building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3. To do this, we have deployed this Spark process on a cluster using AWS.

### Project 5: Data Pipelines with Airflow
